> I build tools that remove friction, surface signal from noise, and make systems easier to reason about. Most projects start as something I need, then slowly turn into something others might find useful.

## Currently Working On

* 🧭 **Internal dashboards** for turning messy data into calm interfaces
* 🧮 **Developer utilities** for APIs, logs, and workflows
* 🧪 **Experiments** around AI as a practical tool, not a gimmick
* 🔌 **Automation and glue code** between systems that do not quite fit

## Interests

* Simple tools with sharp edges
* Calm, readable UIs
* Tooling over frameworks
* Long-lived, boring tech that works
* Making invisible systems visible

## Tech I reach for

* JavaScript and TypeScript
* React, Tailwind, modern CSS
* Node.js, PostgreSQL
* Docker, GitHub Actions
* APIs, automation, scripting

## Open source

Most repositories here fall into a few buckets:

* Small tools I use regularly
* Experiments and prototypes
* Internal tools that grew legs and went public

I prefer fewer projects that are understandable over many half-finished ones.

## GitHub Activity

![GitHub Contribution Graph](https://ghchart.rshah.org/jpdlr)

## What I'm doing

* Building tools to support real-world systems
* Improving dashboards and developer ergonomics
* Exploring how AI fits into existing workflows
* Gradually open-sourcing more internal utilities

## Writing and notes

Occasionally I write short notes or documentation alongside projects when something is worth explaining.

## Connect

* GitHub issues and discussions
* Email in profile

### Philosophy

> Build things you want to use. Keep them small. Let them grow naturally.
