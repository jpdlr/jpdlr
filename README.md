# Jean-Pierre de la Rey

Developer, tinkerer, and open-source maintainer.

I enjoy building **tools that remove friction**, clarify data, and make complex systems easier to work with.

Most of my projects start as things I want for myself and then slowly turn into something others can use.

## What I’m working on

- Small developer tools and CLIs
- Internal dashboards and observability UIs
- Automation and system glue
- Experiments around AI as a practical utility

## Interests

- Calm, readable interfaces
- Turning raw data into insight
- Tooling over frameworks
- Long-lived, boring tech that works

## Tech

- JavaScript / TypeScript
- React, Tailwind
- Node.js, PostgreSQL
- Docker, GitHub Actions
- APIs, automation, scripting

## Open source

Most repositories here fall into one of these categories:

- Utilities I use daily
- Experiments and prototypes
- Internal tools made public

Pinned projects below are a good place to start.
