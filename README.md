> I build tools that remove friction, surface signal from noise, and make systems easier to reason about. Most projects start as something I need, then slowly turn into something others might find useful.

## Currently Working On

* 🧭 **Internal dashboards** for turning messy data into calm interfaces
* 🧮 **Developer utilities** for APIs, logs, and workflows
* 🧪 **Experiments** around AI as a practical tool, not a gimmick
* 🔌 **Automation and glue code** between systems that do not quite fit

## Top Project

### 🐙 [Hydra](https://github.com/jpdlr/hydra)

Hydra is my flagship project: a cross-platform desktop app to orchestrate Claude Code and OpenAI Codex agents in parallel, with live terminals, session resume, and manager-agent orchestration.

- Parallel multi-agent workflows in one workspace
- Claude Code + OpenAI Codex support in the same app
- Session continuity, headless runs, and usage visibility

## Interests

* Simple tools with sharp edges
* Calm, readable UIs
* Tooling over frameworks
* Long-lived, boring tech that works
* Making invisible systems visible

## Tech I reach for

* JavaScript and TypeScript
* React, Tailwind, modern CSS
* Node.js, PostgreSQL
* Docker, GitHub Actions
* APIs, automation, scripting

## Open source

Most repositories here fall into a few buckets:

* Small tools I use regularly
* Experiments and prototypes
* Internal tools that grew legs and went public

I design practical tools for agent-first engineering workflows.

## What I'm doing

* Building tools to support real-world systems
* Improving dashboards and developer ergonomics
* Exploring how AI fits into existing workflows
* Gradually open-sourcing more internal utilities

## Writing and notes

Occasionally I write short notes or documentation alongside projects when something is worth explaining.

## Connect

* GitHub issues and discussions
* Email in profile
